This Shifts The String By A Random String Of Number: 

Let's say random number generated is 13,

then a = m 

and it adds a random symbol after some random number of characters depending upon length of password. This is repeated for every character, even twice for a few characters to maximise security. This algorithm isn't reversible. 

for example

apple = m%62uEEhe(*)^*&^
